4) Reproduce the anlaysis (plots and statistical analysis of the results)

# Corpus
Librispeech : https://www.openslr.org/12
<br/>Thomas : https://gin.g-node.org/LAAC-LSCP/thomas
<br/>Providence: https://gin.g-node.org/LAAC-LSCP/providence

# Working environment

Clone this github repository and move to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaya-sy/EntropyBasedCLDMetrics.git
cd EntropyBasedCLDMetrics
```

Create the Python environment:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

and activate it:

```shell
conda activate ent_cldm
```

# Data preparation

## Prepare the librispeech data for phones _n_-gram language model

The phonemizer requires the espeak backend, it can be installed with this command line: `apt-get install espeak-ng`

```shell
python src/librispeech_for_ngram_lm.py -i [LIBRISPEECH_TRAIN-CLEAN-360_FOLDER] -o data/ngram_lm/
```

This will create two files in `data/ngram_lm`. The one with the `*.orthographic` extension contains the orthographic utterances and the one with `*.phonemized` extension contains the phonemized utterances.

## _n_-gram language model training

We need first to train the _n_-gram language model in order to prepare the data for the other experiments.

For training the _n_-gram language model, you will need to install [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm):

```bash
conda install -c anaconda cmake
git clone https://github.com/kpu/kenlm.git
cd kenlm
python setup.py develop
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 4
```

Once installed in the current directory, you can run the training:

```shell
mkdir checkpoints
kenlm/build/bin/lmplz --discount_fallback -o 5 < data/ngram_lm/librispeech.phonemized > checkpoints/librispeech_360.arpa
```

The trained model will be stored in the `checkpoints` folder.

## Pepare the data for Thomas regression model (Experiment 2A)

### Prepare utterances

You will need to install the Thomas corpus https://gin.g-node.org/LAAC-LSCP/thomas.

To install the thomas corpus using datalad, run the following commands:
```shell
datalad install -r git@gin.g-node.org:/LAAC-LSCP/thomas.git
cd thomas
datalad get annotations/cha/*
datalad get recordings/raw/*
```

Once installed, you can run this command to extract utterances, their cleaned version and the timemarks:

```shell
python src/create_thomas_corpus.py -c [PATH_TO_THOMAS_CORPUS] -o data/Thomas
```

Where `[PATH_TO_THOMAS_CORPUS]` is the path to the installed Thomas corpus.

In the created folder, `orthographic` contains the raw annotations without cleaning. The `cleaned` folder contains the cleaned version of the annotations. And `timemarks` contains the onsets and offsets of each utterance in the audios. All of these are aligned, meaning that the _i<sup>th</sup>_ line of each file corresponds to the _i<sup>th</sup>_ line of the other files.

The `filename.txt` files contain the raw filenames and `months.txt` files contain the ages of the child in months.

### Prepare inputs for the regression model

```shell
> python src/prepare_childes_corpus.py -i data/Thomas/
> python src/prepare_input_files.py -c data/Thomas/ -a [AUDIO_FOLDER] -m checkpoints/librispeech_360.arpa
```

Where `[AUDIO_FOLDER]` is the path to the audio folder of the data installed from the GIN repository. The audio folder is `recordings/raw/`.

## Pepare the data for Librispeech regression model (Experiment 2B)

Create the inputs for the regression model:

```bash
> python src/prepare_librispeech_corpus.py -i [LIBRISPEECH_TRAIN-CLEAN-100_FOLDER] -o data/Librispeech/model_inputs
> python src/prepare_input_files.py -c data/Librispeech/ -a [LIBRISPEECH_TRAIN-CLEAN-100_FOLDER] -m checkpoints/librispeech_360.arpa
```

Where `[LIBRISPEECH_TRAIN-CLEAN-100_FOLDER]` is the path to the folder containing the librispeech train-clean-100.

## Prepare the Providence test data

As for the Thomas corpus, you will also need to install the providence corpus https://gin.g-node.org/LAAC-LSCP/providence.

### Prepare utterances

Extract the utterances of the providence corpus:

```bash
python src/create_providence_corpus_new.py -i [PREPARED_CSV] -c [PATH_TO_PROVIDENCE_CORPUS] -o data/Providence/
```

Where [PREPARED_CSV] is the CSV aleady prepared with cleaned utterances, the timemarks, etc.

### Prepare inputs for the regression model

Create the inputs for the model:

```bash
> python src/prepare_childes_corpus.py -i data/Providence/
> python src/prepare_input_files.py -c data/Providence/ -a [AUDIO_FOLDER] -m checkpoints/librispeech_360.arpa
```

Where `[AUDIO_FOLDER]` is the path to the audio folder of the data installed from the GIN repository. The audio folder is `recordings/raw/`.

# Run the trainings

## Experiment 1A: _n_-gram language model training on Librispeech train-clean-360

The model is already trained during the data prepration and is saved on `checkpoints/librispeech_360.arpa`.
So we will not retrain it again.

## Experiment 2A: Entropy predictions training on Thomas

Run the regression model training on Thomas:

```bash
python src/train.py -c configs/thomas.yaml
```

The trained model will be stored in the folder `checkpoints` as `Thomas_30h_Librispeech360_en.pt`.

## Experiment 2B: Entropy predictions training on Librispeech train-clean-100

Run the regression model training on librispeech train-clean-100:

```bash
python src/train.py -c configs/librispeech.yaml
```

The trained model will be stored in the folder `checkpoints` as `Librispeech_100h_Librispeech360_en.pt`.

# Run the testing

## Experiment 1A: Text entropies

```bash
python src/compute_entropies_ngram_lm.py
```

This will create a csv file named `Librispeech_360h.csv` in the folder `results`.

## Experiment 2A: Entropy predictions using Thomas test data

```bash
python src/compute_entropies_whisper.py -c configs/test.yaml -m checkpoints/Thomas_30h_Librispeech360_en.pt
```

This will create a csv file named `Thomas_30h_Librispeech360_en.csv` in the folder `results`.

## Experiment 2B: Entropy predictions using Librispeech test data

```bash
python src/compute_entropies_whisper.py -c configs/test.yaml -m checkpoints/Librispeech_100h_Librispeech360_en.pt
```

This will create a csv file named `Librispeech_100h_Librispeech360_en.csv` in the folder `results`.

# Analysis

## Prepare the CSVs for analysis

### Experiment 1A

```bash
python src/prepare_for_analysis.py -i results/Librispeech_360h.csv
```

This will create a csv file named `Librispeech_360h_analysis.csv` in the folder `results`.

### Experiment 1B

```bash
python src/prepare_for_analysis_hubert.py -i results/HuBERT-nat_entropy_ngram-2-merge-False_mmap.csv -c [CHILDES_PATH_PROVIDENCE]
```

This will create a csv file named `HuBERT-nat_entropy_ngram-2-merge-False_mmap_analysis.csv` in the folder `results`.

### Experiment 1C

```bash
python src/prepare_for_analysis_hubert.py -i results/HuBERT-tts_entropy_ngram-2-merge-False_mmap.csv -c [CHILDES_PATH_PROVIDENCE]
```

This will create a csv file named `HuBERT-tts_entropy_ngram-2-merge-False_mmap_analysis.csv` in the folder `results`.

### Experiment 2A

```bash
python src/prepare_for_analysis.py -i results/Thomas_30h_Librispeech_en.csv
```

This will create a csv file named `Thomas_30h_Librispeech_en_analysis.csv` in the folder `results`.

### Experiment 2B

```bash
python src/prepare_for_analysis.py -i results/Librispeech_100h_Librispeech360_en.csv
```

This will create a csv file named `Librispeech_100h_Librispeech360_en_analysis.csv` in the folder `results`.

## Plottings

You can reproduce the figures of the paper with this notebook: `analysis/plots.Rmd`

## Mixed Linear Models

You can reproduce the mixed linear models of the paper with this notebook: `analysis/models.Rmd`

## Correlations

We give the MLU, IPSyn and VOCD already computed on the Providence corpus. The CSV file is in `extra/chi.kideval.csv`.

But before computing the correlations with the entropy metric, you will need to merge `chi.kideval.csv` with the CSVs produced in the previous experiments.

For the experiments 1A, 2A and 2B, you can prepare the CSVs for computing the correlations using this command:

```bash
python src/merge_metrics.py -i [CSV_FOR_ANALYSIS]
```

Where `[CSV_RESULTS_FOR_ANALYSIS]`is the path to CSV results already prepared for analysis.

For the experiments 1B and 1C, you can prepare the CSVs for computing the correlations using this command:

```bash
python src/merge_metrics_hubert.py -i [CSV_FOR_ANALYSIS]
```

Once done, you can use the notebook `analysis/correlations.Rmd` to compute correlations.
