uhoh what happened to my thingy  
wait a minute  
the toy book  
kay  
I gotta see where it is  
is it called Sophie in toyland  
are you sure  
who read that one to you  
nobody you just saw it  
okay let's see hey the frog prince  
that reminds of something else we just saw called what  
right  
this one  
Sophie in toyland look at this book is coming apart  
Sophie was very sad she couldn't find Peter the panda anywhere  
he was her favorite toy and she took him to bed every night  
it was almost bedtime and Sophie didn't know how she'd get to sleep without him  
Sophie sat on Beauty her rockinghorse and rocked sadly back and forth  
hey you have a rockinghorse like that  
what's yours called  
 
as her eyes filled with tears something she didn't know what made her rock faster than ever before she closed her eyes there was a tremendous whistling in her ears  
the next minute she was tumbling head over heels through the air then floating gently down to land on something soft  
Sophie blinked her eyes  
where was she exactly  
hello Sophie growled a voice from above her head she opened her eyes and looked up  
the legs of a bed her bed towered above her it must have grown  
peaking over the edge of her quilt was big Ted next to him was little Ted  
see them  
hello Sophie squeaked little Ted  
her teddy bears were talking she looked around she was tiny  
help she gulped I'm tiny I've shrunk her eyes filled with tears  
hello Sophie welcome to toyland called a voice from across the room  
it was Samantha Sophie's doll  
can you point to where you think Samantha Sophie's doll is  
right  
you're as tall as I am gasped Sophie  
I'm no bigger than my own doll what's going on  
don't cry said Samantha gently you're in toyland that's all  
we're all little here you'll grow big when Beauty takes you home again  
Sophie turned her head  
Beauty now tiny just like her was on the floor beside her  
how come Beauty got small too  
even the toy shrank  
in toyland  
look out below cried big Ted we're coming down squeaked little Ted  
big Ted tied one end of a cord to the bed and dropped the other end to the floor it was the sash of Sophie's bathrobe the bears climbed down it  
let's call the other toys suggested Samantha wake up everybody she cried  
suddenly all of Sophie's toys sprang to life  
Sophie's tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toybox jumped down from it  
let's play suggested big Ted  
this is fun said Sophie  
as she played games with her toys would you like to do that Violet  
oh yeah  
is that how she's gonna get her panda  
oh yeah I don't know  
where's Peter asked Sophie suddenly  
they looked everywhere but Peter the panda was no where to be found  
they gazed at each other in dismay then Sophie heard a soft noise  
everyone stood still and listened  
someone's calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing  
it's coming from the top of the bookcase said Sophie  
they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was Peter the panda  
I'm stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice  
gosh said Sophie I must have put you there when I was told to straighten up my room  
please get me down begged Peter the panda but how asked Sophie  
the bookcase is so high and we're so little  
what can they do Violet  
you know what I think they should do  
I think she should go back on her horse and get big again and then she can just walk right over to it and pick it up right  
I know a way said big Ted he ran off and came back pushing Sophie's toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea  
it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engine's ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase  
now climb down Peter shouted Samantha  
oh no I can't said Peter don't worry said big Ted I'll get him down  
he climbed up the ladder and lifted Peter onto his shoulders  
everybody cheered and clapped when big Ted carried Peter safely to the ground  
thank you said Sophie hugging big Ted and kissing his cheek  
just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo  
uhoh said Sophie it's time for bed I hafta go  
bye bye toys thank you  
goodbye shouted the toys  
please come again  
Sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock  
in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again  
big Ted and little Ted were slumped at the foot of the bed  
the fireengine with Samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor  
the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places  
it seemed as though Sophie's adventure in toyland never happened  
the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and Peter the panda was lying safe on Sophie's pillow  
lucky Sophie had been to toyland she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found Peter and panda too  
Peter the panda  
she couldn't wait to go to bed and dream about her wonderful adventure  
hey I think it was a dream do you  
okay  
kay  
far away beyond the widest oceans lies the enchanted land of Feria  
the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short  
it is such a beautiful place and the crops grow so well that there is little for the Ferian people to do but enjoy themselves in the sun  
so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories  
hey I wanna go there do you  
mhm  
some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy  
but one year it wasn't like that  
that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried  
for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet  
and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open  
not good enough said the king something must be done  
which one you think's the king Vi  
let Violet choose please Maxwell  
which one do you think Vi  
the same as he said  
I was gonna guess that guy  
cause you know why  
he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think he's right because that one has the crown on  
right  
but it's funny the king's usually old isn't he  
it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring  
the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king  
doesn't he like us anymore  
I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member  
but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately  
they must start um they must um  
the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say  
finally he said they er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things  
do you know what a work thing is Violet  
in the winter yeah that's a type of work in the winter  
digging too yep so because the king told them to the people of Feria went to work at first they didn't even know what to do  
then when they looked up the word in the Feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didn't like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves  
but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads 
they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road  
and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work  
but it still kept snowing and the lakes didn't thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didn't bloom  
what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council  
perhaps the spring unicorn doesn't know how hard we are working said the wise man  
well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet  
that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the Ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for  
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived  
do you know where he lives Violet  
and where's that  
what do you call that place you think  
he lives in the same place  
how come they couldn't find him then  
oh they didn't see him  
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived  
nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the Whistler  
I'm fed up with winter and I've got nothing to better to do so I might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the Whistler  
see him here  
so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey  
and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains  
I shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley  
hey Max you're right  
where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere Ferian find your way here  
I played my flute and followed the notes explained the Whistler  
then he demonstrated with a quick tune  
his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him  
when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn  
why are you here the spring unicorn asked  
because you failed to come to Feria this year  
ha exclaimed the spring unicorn I couldn't be bothered to come because the people of Feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs  
but what you say is no longer true why not Vi  
why not  
now they are right  
we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music  
maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end I'll tell you what I'll do  
providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to Feria I shall accompany you  
and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy  
can I fly on your back asked the Whistler hopefully  
no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and I won't have time to listen to all that music I want you to play  
we shall walk back the way you came  
oh drat thought the Whistler but how do they walk across the ocean  
the Whistler returned the way he had come and through his journey he played the most beautiful music  
that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way  
eventually they arrived in the mountains above Feria look  
see them up there  
the Whistler pointing down at the village see how hard the people are working  
indeed they were some were shoveling snow from their gardens but as soon as they had finished more snow fell to replace it  
some were clearing snow from the roads  
some were fixing leaks but as soon as they finished more snow fell  
indeed they are working but are they happy in their work  
listen sad the Whistler  
the unicorn listened  
faintly from the village came the sound of someone laughing someone else was whistling 
someone else was singing  
oh yes said the Whistler I think you can say they are happy  
I believe you are right you shall have your spring back again  
I shall continue to bring a new spring year after year just as long as the people remain happy and contented and do not ever become lazy again  
and that's how it was and that's how it still is  
which is why every year the Ferian spring is always heralded by the most beautiful music anyone has ever heard  
wow
