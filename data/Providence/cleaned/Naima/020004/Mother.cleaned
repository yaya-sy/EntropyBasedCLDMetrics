huh  
she's making something  
she has the Cuisinart just like we have  
look at that  
Arthur's mommy has a Cuisinart  
it's like a blender  
you know the one we have  
it's shaped like that  
it's Arthur's turn to cook  
oh  not his mommy's turn  
should I keep reading the book  
that's Mrs Tibble  
later that afternoon Arthur and DW took Kate for a walk  
look shouted the Tibble twins  there's DW

Mrs Tibble looked worried  
I'm in a terrible pickle she said

you have a naked arm and an arm with a shirt on it  
an arm with a g l i r t on it  
this is Naima's latest thing in the last three days  
we've been adding consonant clusters to the beginning of words that aren't the ones that belong there just for fun and especially in a swearing manner  
one sleeve on and one sleeve off  
you wanna put the other one on

what part of him did you pet  
yes  
you like to pet his tail  
what kind of toys did he have

yes  he had a tennis ball  
you're right Naima  
he did have a regular ball also  
yeah  I guess you're right  
and he had that funny  long red toy

you're just calling the koala Koala these days  
right  
Arthur

what's he doing in this picture  
do you wanna sit down here and read it with me  
sit down  
sit down right here  
we'll read the book together  
okay  
babysitting is such a big responsibility  said Arthur  
he's talking to his sister whose name is DW  
she has a helmet in her hands  
I'm a little nervous  said Arthur  
he said I'm a little nervous  
that's his little  uhhh  brother or sister  
we'll be right here if you want to call us said Father  
here's my crash helmet  said DW  
you'll need it  
why  
asked Arthur  
are you coming along  
you think I'm trouble said DW  
just wait  
they're eating pizza  look  
look at this  
come here and look this picture  
what's that  
it's a special kind of a box for what  
it's a special kind of a box for pizza  
what else are they eating  what's that  
is that a salad  
what are they drinking  
what's in that  
that's Arthur's Daddy  
yup  
hi Sleepy Bear  
Mommy e f g  
whose full name is Mommy e f g  
that's his full name  
that's a funny name  
hi Sleepy Bear  
oh that's the macaque puppet  
hi macaque puppet  
hi macaque  
where'd his tail go  
tail  
macaque has a tail  
it's right there  
where did it go  
yes the elephant has a small tail  
the macaque has a 
big tail  
and you could you also say 
the macaque has a long tail  
and the elephant has a short tail  
a short tail  
is that a lion or a duck  
I know that what I said it was  
but look at its feet  
I think it's a duck  Naima  
I think it's a duck lion  
could we call it 
could we call it Lionel  
that could be the duck's name  
Lionel  
or do you wanna give the duck a different name  
Koalaba  
I think I'll rewind this a bit to double check it  
where'd it go  
where did the macaque tail go  
oh let's see  
that's a pretty good view of the couch  
Arthur  
let's read over here for a little bit  
let's look at the Yoka book  
did I say what the date is  
March eighteenth  
wanna look at the Yoka book  
come sit up here and read  
oh sorry  
are you okay  
do you want me to get the Arthur book and bring it over here  
we'll look at that book  
come sit next to Mommy  
come sit here and we'll read it together  
Sleepy Bear's gonna sit right there  okay  
you wanna sit right next to me  
put your bottom right over here  
how about like this  
okay  
very good  
Arthur  
what is this on your pants by the way  
you had fuzz on your pants  
okay  what's going on here  
let's see  
ohmygoodness  is Arthur gonna babysit  
that means he's gonna take care of those children  
Arthur is here walking past his friends  
he's telling them I'm going to take care of those twins  
who is that  
what kind of ears does that animal have  
what kind of animal is that  
is it a rabbit  
oh  let's see what's happening in this picture  
ohmygoodness  
that baby's diaper is leaking  
you can see the drops of peepee coming out of the diaper  
and Arthur is 
Arthur's pants got all wet  
yeah  I think that baby's diaper is leaking  
he needs a new diaper  
I think the baby is crying  
and that's DW  
she's crying in that picture  
and what's happening in that picture  
that baby's throwing up  
remember  you threw up when you were sick  
I think she is sick  
she's throwing up some green stuff that came out of her tummy  
that's what happened to you when you were sick  
you were throwing up also  
yeah  sometimes it was orange  
that's what the baby's throwing up  
cause she's sick she needs to have some medicine maybe  
and here's a picture of Arthur and his sister DW  
she's jumping on the sofa  
Arthur's trying to read a book  
his sister's making a lot of noise  
that's Mrs Tibble  
she has to go out  
 
the cat looks like she's hiding  
yup  she might 
well DW's not in this picture  
there's DW  
okay you wanna look at this page  
DW's jumping on the sofa  
that's Arthur who's holding the crying baby  
that's his sister I think  
oh she's having peepee come out of her diaper  
it's leaking  
she needs her diaper changed  
Arthur has to change her now  
she's throwing up  
that's Arthur  
he's saying yuck  
let's see what happens next  
those children are playing very rambunctiously  
yes  Arthur is holding the throwing up baby  
Arthur's holding the baby who is throwing up  
I think maybe he's trying to help her feel better  
hm  I wonder where Daddy is  
he was supposed to come home  
maybe he's reading his paper at work  
that's DW  
she's crying  
her overalls  
she's wearing a dress that looks like overalls  
what is she doing  
she's laughing  
there's all of Arthur's friends  
are you saying to Mommy to read some  
Arthur remembered what that was like  
there I read it  
I think that that 
can you read the letters there on that book that DW was reading  
what letters are those  
can you see them  
oh you wanna talk about that picture with the babies throwing up  
do you think Arthur might give her some medicine to help her feel better  
yeah  
there he is  
he's her big brother  
do you want me to talk about that picture  
that's the picture where the baby's diaper is leaking and Arthur's pants are getting wet  
see how the pants are dark on his thighs  
that means the baby's diaper leaked  
the baby's diaper leaked and made Arthur's pants all wet  
I think he probably will get another diaper for that baby  
and he will probably also change his pants  
what thing away  
those green things are the throw up that is coming out of the baby's mouth  
oh  you think he'll clean it up  
yeah you're right  
he'll probably clean it up 
he'll probably get a wet rag and clean it off of this chair  
clean the green throw up off of the chair  
and then put the rag in the laundry or throw it away  
I think he will because he's the one who's taking care of the baby  
when you're taking care of someone who's sick you do that kind of thing  
you clean up the throw up and stuff like that  
she is throwing up  
I bet she doesn't feel good  
she probably feels lousy  
I'm so glad you're better though Naima  
Naima is all better  
what happened with the nurses  
in the hospital  
they did a lot of things to take care of you  
well 
they put a special bangle on your arm which had blue tape on it  
and they connected a hose to your hand  
so that you could get the medicine that you needed  
they checked to make sure you had enough medicine  
well  they took your temperature 
by sticking that thermometer in your ear  
they took your temperature  
they listened to your chest with a stethoscope  
one of the nurses gave you a grizzlybear  
it was Janet who gave you the grizzlybear  
I think Barbara did take off the blue bangle  
which was like a bandage  
she took off the blue sticky tape that was on your arm  
she took out the needle  
there was a needle  
she took it all off  
oh and you had a bangle on your ankle also  
that's right and she took that off  
I think that had your name on it  
you had that bangle on your ankle too  
I forgot that  
and you had some kind of a special nightgown  
what was it  
what was on it  
was it bears  
what was on the nightgown  
I think maybe it was little bears  
little pink bears  
oh you're right it was elephants  
you had the special elephant nightgown when you were at the hospital  
and there was a special crib there  
do you remember that crib  
and Mommy slept next to you  
on that chair  
next to your crib  right  
and Mommy nursed you too  to help you feel better  
remember  
you were sick  yeah  
the book fell down that was on my lap  
the nurses brought food for Mommy to eat  
they took away your diapers after I changed you and they weighed them  
on a scale  
a scale is for finding out how heavy something is  
it measures how heavy something is  
we weighed Naima too  
we weighed you  
you weighed twenty five pounds  
we already talked about it  
who's throwing up  
mm  who is the baby's brother  
Arthur  
can we 
you wanna turn the page and see what else happens in this story  
oh okay  we already saw this page  
there's a cat  
there's the two little kids  
he's gonna take care of them for a while  
ohmygoodness  it looks like they're playing with cards  
he's jumping  
he's saying  I'll be the sheriff  
ooh  Mommy's got quite a stomach ache  
I think we're gonna stop taping  
it's my tummy that hurts  
wanna kiss my tummy  
very nice  
almost all better  
I am sick  
I'm better since you've kissed my belly  
are you upside down

is that the zoo vehicle  
it looks like a zookeeper  
hi zookeeper  
oh it's a zoo vehicle

yeah  it looks like a good zoo vehicle  
like you could carry an animal in the back of it  
are you going to put an animal in there  
an elephant perhaps  
where's it gonna go  
oh and it has a  it has a little 
it can walk up the back of it like a ramp  
that's like a ramp they can walk into it  
and sit on the side  
that's nice  
does that zookeeper have the word zoo on his shirt  
z o o  
I think so  
z o o  
spells zoo  right

it makes a little noise when I take the lid off  doesn't it  
I can put some juice and water in it to make it juicy water  
still you wanted to like it  
mm Mommy likes apricot juice  
this is actually apricot nectar  
nectar is what bees eat  
right  
bees eat nectar  
they do they do indeed  
bees don't nurse  
lotsof animals don't nurse  
penguins don't nurse that's right  
yeah  
yeah  her 
yes  
yeah  
well  I can call and just mention it to them at least  
so that it doesn't go completely um 
you know  
looks like you're outta food there  
do you want something else to eat Naima  
whatd'ya think  
I don't think that we're out of it  but I do think that you could have something else  
like 
raisins  
or what else  
is that what it feels like  
your hair was a little outta control there  
how bout some bread with 
oh how bout some bear food Naima  
are you a bear cub that wants to eat bear food  
or you could have some egg yolk  
I'm the mommy bear  
and you're the baby bear  
PoppaBear  
the story of Goldilocks  
I need to tell you that while you're eating  
what are you gonna eat  
you're gonna have some fresh grated apple  
does that sound good  
I can do that but what are you gonna eat while I'm telling it to you  
I will tell it to you but you've got to be eating something  
okay  
it's a deal egg yolk and egg white  
yes  
good idea Naima  
first I'm gonna take the shell off of the egg  
cause we don't eat the shell with the eggs  
how do you spell egg  
it does have a g in it  
egg is spelled 
e g g  
this shell does not want to come off this egg  
it's difficult  and Mommy's having a tough time with this egg  
you think Daddy will do it if Mommy can't do it  
hm 
while I'm doing it it's just a 
I didn't cook the egg properly  
that's why the shell is sticking to the egg  
like tape  
yes tape sticks to photographs sometimes  
especially in the book we made for you called Naima's journeys right  
is that what you're thinking of  
alright let's see here  
let's slice this egg for you  
should we get a plate maybe  
what color plate's that  
here's some egg white  
here's some egg yolk  
mm  big chunks of egg yolk  
they look like chunks of cheese  
go head and eat some and I'll tell you the story of Goldilocks  
once upon a time there was a little girl who went on a walk in the 
forest  
she saw a snake  
you like that variation don't you  
she saw a snake 
she saw a robin  
she saw a badger  
she liked walking in the forest  
so that she could see all the different animals  
she was having fun  but she was walking for a long time  
and then she got tired  
and she  first she found the house  
a house up ahead  
she was hungry and tired  
so first she decided to knock on the door  
knock knock knock  
but there was no answer  
so she walked in the house  
and then what happens next  
she wants to find the bears  
what does she see when she walks in the house  
three chairs yes  three rocking chairs  
a big one  
a medium sized one  
and a little one  
and then 
she sat in the biggest rocking chair  
and she started to rock and rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock  
but then she stopped  
and she said this rocking chair is too 
fast  
so she climbed out of that rocking chair  
she got into the next rocking chair and that was the medium sized rocking chair  
and she rocked rocked rocked rocked rocked rocked  
and she stopped and she said 
wait a minute  this rocking chair is too what  
slow  
so what did she do  
she climbed out of that rocking chair  
and 
she climbed into the little rocking chair  
and she rocked rocked rocked rocked rocked rocked  
and she said oh  hey  
I like this rocking chair  
it's just right for me  
and then what happens  
she's rocking in that little rocking chair for a long time right  
she rock and she rocked rocked rocked rocked  
until it broke into bits  
right  
and then what happens  
she wants to fix it  
well she's a little girl  she doesn't really have access to tools and screws  
and she's in somebody else's house  
she doesn't know where they keep their tools so she can't fix it  
so she goes into the kitchen because she's hungry  
I think you're right Naima  
I'm slicing a bagel  
cause that's what I'm going to eat for breakfast  
a bagel's like an o isn't it  
so she goes into the kitchen and she sees 
what does she see on the table there  
yes  
three bowls of porridge  
and one of them is big  
and one of them is medium sized  
and one of them is  
she sits down in front of the big bowl of porridge and she takes a bite of it  
she says  
oh this porridge is too hot  
she needs to cool it down  
then she goes over to the medium sized bowl of porridge and she takes a bite  
she makes a face like this  
then she says  this porridge is too cold  
so she gets down outta that chair  
she goes to the littlest bowl of porridge  
she takes the spoon  dips it in the porridge then sticks it in her mouth and takes a bite  
 
and that porridge was just right  
that's right Naima you know this story don't you  
where's Mommy's coffee  
and 
and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge  
and she eats and eats eats eats eats eats eats  
until what happens  
she finishes it  
that's right til it's all gone  
and then she wants to wash her bowl off  
okay  and so then she takes the bowl and she takes it over to the sink  
she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge  
and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean  
it might've been that she wanted to dry the bowl  
and cook more porridge what a good idea  
mommy bear  
is Goldilocks mommy bear  
I don't think so  
she's in the bears' house though  
she's in the bears' house  
she washes the bowl and she puts it back  
she doesn't cook more porridge I don't think so  
not in this story anyway  
she's tired right  
so she should find a bed to sleep in  
she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees  
and she tries to get comfortable  
and she says uh wait a minute this bed is too hard  
she can't get comfy  it's not a comfy bed for her  
and then what happens  
and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium sized bed  
she tries to get comfortable  
 
I can't get comfortable  
she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow  
and then she gets out of the medium sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all  
what happens  
she's in the littlest bed and she says mm oh this is so comfy  
and she falls asleep  
the medium sized bed is the one that's too soft  
the littlest bed the little bed that's right  
the little bed is the one that is very  very comfy  
she falls asleep  
and pretty soon what happens  
the bears come home to their house  
they walk in the door  they want to rock in their chairs  
they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock  
and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops  
and he says somebody's been rocking in my chair  
he's very puzzled  
I think you're right  
I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the PoppaBear's chair  
and then 
and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair  
right  
she starts to rock and what does she say  
she says  somebody's been rocking in my chair too  
mhm I think you're right  
yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point  
and then the baby bear goes over and 
there's a bird over at the feeder Naima  
birds are coming to eat  
can you see them  
there's a lot of sun in this room  
there  now you're out of the sun  
can you see the birds  
oh maybe they'll come back  
you rearranging your cups  
hey you ate a lot of that egg  good job  
what else would you like to eat  
sesame  
okay  let me find the sesame for you  
would you like a pile of sesame right here  
here's a pile  
well I forgot to buy jam at the store yesterday  
we're almost out of strawberry jam  
what else would you 
you're eating the sesame  is it good  
good  
do you wanna eat some applesauce Naima  
I'll get you some applesauce  
you want bread and jam  
you can have some of my bagel  
there's no more jam right now  
do you want applesauce too  
you want some plain bagel  
I think there's 
what happened to that  
uh yeah  you can have some of my plain bagel  
let's see here  
this is Mommy's plain bagel  
and I can get you some apple sauce  
oh yeah  the other part of the story um 
where did we leave off  
the baby bear looked at his rocking chair  
and it was broken  
and he said someone's been rocking in my rocking chair and they broke it  
ugh he was kinda mad I think  
so then 
mama bear said  don't worry we'll fix it  
and then where do the bears go  
into the kitchen  
cause they're hungry  
they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was  
when you walk for awhile you get hungry  
they've been walking for a long time  
um so the papa bear looked at his bowl  he didn't even hafta take a bite  
he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's been eating my porridge  
oh no there's an uhoh here  
yes  I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge  
I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here  
let's attach this over here  
and then the mama bear also says 
somebody's been eating my porridge too  
I think you're right  
and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean  remember because she washed it out this time  
and he says somebody's been eating my porridge  
and she ate it all up  
she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty  
I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point  
do you think so  
and the papa bear says  don't worry we'll make you some more porridge  
so the bears ate all their porridge  
then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap  
you're having sesame with applesauce mm  
who likes the bagel in her porridge  
she likes bagels with porridge mm  
hm  I'm just remembering something  
they go upstairs and the papa bear says  somebody's been sleeping in my bed  
the story of the day  
I'm still telling the Goldilocks story  
you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday  
okay  
um yesterday was Wednesday  
we woke up 
Mommy made coffee  
and in the morning we went out and did errands  
we went to the bank  
we went to the hardware store  
we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you  
and then we went to the 
dry cleaner's  
we stopped in the shoe store for a minute  
we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size  
that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long  
you have cold feet  
really  
it looks like there's some sun on your feet  
I can see it  
there on your left foot there's some sun yeah  
now it's in the sun can you feel the sun  
I meant can your foot feel the sun  
oh my God  
I think we're gonna go to town hall before we go to toddler time  
has a doggie named  
is he a silly dog  
he likes to roll  
then he was shaking the water off yeah  
mm hm  
what a nice doggie  you were patting him  
you were patting him  
mm hm  
yup  there was a fence there  
at that vacation house  
and vacation house  
that's what it was  
that place we visited  it was the vacation house that and were staying at  
and  
and that was in a different town called Provincetown  
it was like a city except it was really a town  
Provincetown  
that's where they were having their vacation  
in Provincetown  
did you see a bird  
no there's still some seeds there  
I think their seeds are all gone in the big feeder  
in this little feeder right here there's some seeds  
I can see them  
if we're gonna go to town hall we may be too late already  
well I hope we're gonna go to both  
I just forgot that there's something happening at town hall today  
okay
