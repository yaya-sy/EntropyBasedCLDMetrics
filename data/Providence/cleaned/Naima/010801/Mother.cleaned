you know where Naima's room is  
here  
let's sit on the rug and do it that's a great idea  
here seat on Mommy  
it's fun to be four  
one  
one  
it's fun to be eight  
it's fun to be  
she is chewing on a guy  
actually looks like she's chewing on a bear toy  
yep  
much what's this baby doing  
like she is eating maybe  
okay when you are one you have lotsof 
you want to  
and make 
lotsof noise  
you can drink from your

and feed yourself  
yeah there's a bear Daddy and bear baby looking at a book together

bed  
what's this baby doing  
looks like she's yawning to me  
and she's wearing a towel and so is she

are you playing a game  
where's the clown  
oh clownie m o w n i ep where did you go  
oh there  
I'm gonna put the ribbons back

they would probably fit very nicely  
and you can put the ribbons in the tennis ball container  
where did that go in  
these might make a good noise if we shake them
