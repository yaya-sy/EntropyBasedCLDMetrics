and you're allowed to hug that one right  
you're allowed to touch that sculpture that's the only one in the museum that we're allowed to touch right  
we can't touch the Buddah because the Buddah is so so old that sometimes if we touch it it could break

uhp  
Spinosaurus what's this  
what's this  
yeah what's this  
what's this  
what's this  
yesterday we went on a class trip to the museum of natural history  
we were very excited  
Gaspard and Lisa please try to stay out of trouble our teacher said as we got on the bus  
on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see  
Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us  
the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything  
butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale  
but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting  
oh those are some extinct animals  
those are extinct animals which means they lived a very long time ago  
it looks like Gaspard and Lisa doesn't it  
yeah  
that's right  
Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals  
the museum may want to keep you forever  
everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea  
Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan  
first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars  
we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues  
I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice  
some of them even took pictures of us  
lotsof pictures  
our plan worked perfectly  
so perfectly that our class left without us  
the lights went out and the door closed oh no  
we were locked in the museum  
what's to become of us Lisa cried  
don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave  
but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary  
it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling  
ah we shouted help  
but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us  
our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them  
yeah  
let's put this one back  
hey  
yikes  
wow oh really wow  
Nemo loved everything about school  
he loved swimming there everyday with his dad  
he loved his classmates he loved his teachers and he loved to learn  
and he really loved field trips  
even though on his very first trip he was f i s h  n a p p e dp by a scuba diving dentist and brought to an office aquarium in Sydney  
but that's another story  
every morning Nemo's dad Marlin would take him to school  
along the way Nemo always liked to ask his dad lotsof questions  
what's a whale's tongue like  
how many clownfish can a shark eat in one gulp  
why are we called clownfish asked Nemo  
we're not funny at all  
Nemo saw his best friends Tadpole and Sheldon they loved to play tag and algae in the middle before school started  
Mr Ray was on school yard duty that morning he was everyone's favorite teacher  
Nemo and his friends had a special song they made up just for him  
he's our favorite teacher hip hip hooray  
before the big spotted manta we love Mr Ray  
then it was time for school to begin the first class of the day was music taught by 
Senor Seaweed  
Nemo and his classmates were getting ready for the spring concert  
Nemo played the conch shell Sheldon played the clams Tad strummed along on some kelp and Pearl played sanddollar tambourines  
Mr Ray taught science  
today's lesson was your ocean home  
Mr Ray called on Nemo where do you live Nemo  
anemone I mean anemone  
I mean 
where does Nemo live  
an anemone that's right  
I guess Tad lives in the ocean  
hm really I think just clownfish live in an anemone  
hm that's interesting  
then it was lunchtime  
there were lotsof lunchroom rules  
mhm  
yes I think that Tad Nemo and Sheldon are boys and Pearl is a girl  
yeah  
mhm  
I think so yeah  
which blue and green fish  
I think that is a boy  
yeah  
Nemo took out his lunch  
I'll trade you my kelp sandwich for your algae pizza he said to Tad  
yum said Tad  
mhm  
yeah  
after lunch was recess yay  
everyone had fun playing hide and seek but then Sandy Plankton got in a bit of trouble  
it's like my dad always says says Nemo it's all fun and games until someone gets stuck in a giant clam  
oh no  
such a big big clam  
once Sandy was free it was time for Nemo's next class  
it turned out there was a guest teacher that day  
Dory  
hi Elmo she said waving to Nemo  
Elmo isn't Nemo  
Nemo's not Elmo  
that's right  
Dory was teaching the class how to speak whale  
repeat after me she instructed  
that's good whale  
what did you say the class asked eagerly  
I just said hello said Dory  
then it was show and tell time Pearl brought in a cool piece of coral she had found and Sheldon the seahorse had some big news  
his dad was having babies  
who wants to go next asked Mr Hermit  
um oh Mr Hermit the crab see there's his little claws behind everyone  
these are his eyes  
see  
today I have some very special visitors for you all to meet  
come in guys  
Anchor Bruce and Chum swam in  
pleased ta meet ya said Chum  
don't worry kids we don't eat fish anymore well we try not to anyway  
uh Chum said that  
I think so  
that's right  
after a brief question and answer period the sharks left everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief  
all too soon it was time to go home  
the students filled into the schoolyard to wait for their parents to pick them up  
Nemo couldn't wait to see his dad and tell him all the fun things that had happened  
they sand the rest of the Mr Ray song as they waited  
he's our science teacher we think he's swell  
sometimes we act goofy but he never does yell  
aw shucks said Mr Ray looking pleased  
soon Nemo's dad arrived how was your day today he asked Nemo as they swam home  
dad it was awesome Nemo cried Sandy got stuck in a clam Dory taught whale I brought in the sharks for show and tell  
I can't wait till tomorrow  
Marlin shook his head sadly I'm sorry Nemo I can't let you go to school tomorrow because 
you don't go to school on Saturday  
you go to school Tuesday and Thursday  
that's when you go to school  
that's right  
who's in the green room  
okay
