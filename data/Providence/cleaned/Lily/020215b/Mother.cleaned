Frederick 
dandelion 
that's his daddy 
you're right 
Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed 
after doing his daily exercises 
Dandelion looked out of the window 
blinked his eyes and said I wonder if the mail has come 
he put on his sweater and went outside to the mail box 
there was a letter and it was written in fancy gold ink 
dear Dandelion you are invited to my tea and taffy party on Saturday afternoon at half passed three 
come as you are 
sincerely Jennifer Giraffe 
Dandelion was very excited 
it's a good thing I'm getting a hair cut today he said 
as soon as he washed and dried the dishes 
and made his bed nice and neat 
he ran down the street to the barber shop 
Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him 
first he trimmed Dandelion's hair 
and then gave him a shampoo 
Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to 
right he's cleaning his nails 
when Lou Kangaroo had finished Dandelion looked a bit foolish 
his mane was frizzy and fuzzy and completely unrulish 
silly 
maybe a wave would help Lou suggested showing him a picture in the latest fashion magazine for lions 
Dandelion agreed 
this was exactly what he needed 
so Lou went about curling his mane 
magnificent 
magnificent 
magnificent 
magnificent 
very good honey 
but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party 
this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor 
and it just fits you 
all you need now is a cap and a cane 
Happy Crane will be happy to help you 
that's Happy Crane 
it's nearly half past three said Dandelion 
I've just time to get something for my hostess 
a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect 
he knew this tall door very well 
having been here many times before 
he rang the bell 
when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised 
yes she said 
what can I do for you 
but I'm here for your party he said 
why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said 
you must have the wrong address 
and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face 
I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake 
but the door stayed tight shut 
Dandelion walked back and forth down the block 
the sky grew dark 
and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet 
and his snappy cap flew off 
they blew away in the wind 
oh no 
to make matters worse it began to rain in 
Torrance 
Dandelion dropped his cane 
and stood under a weeping willow tree 
but the rain pored down through the branches 
Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled 
he took off his jacket 
and hung it on a willow branch 
luckily he had kept on his sweater 
at last the rain stopped 
and the warm sunshine came down 
Dandelion sat on Jennifer Giraffe's front steps until his mane was dry 
more dandelions 
they didn't blow away 
they had protected from the wind and rain 
he picked the dandelions and said I think I will try again 
and rang the bell 
well if it isn't our friend Dandelion 
we've been waiting for over an hour for you 
I do hope you weren't caught in that awful cloud burst 
everyone at the party greeted him hardly 
and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door 
Dandelion almost spilt his cup of tea 
what's he drinking 
is it delicious 
oh yummy 
Miss Giraffe was so flustered she got herself tangled in her 
I promise I will never do such a thing again she said 
and I promise you I will never again try to turn myself into a stylish dandy said Dandelion 
from now on I'll always be just 
plain me
