one day Mister and Misses Brown were standing in Paddington station  
they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school  
suddenly Mr Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags  
look over there he said to Mrs Brown  
I'm sure I saw a 
a bear  
a bear said Mrs Brown  
in Paddington station  
don't be silly Henry there can't be  
but there it was it had a funny kind of hat and was sitting all by itself in an old suitcase near the lost property office  
as they drew near the bear stood up and politely drew raised it's hat  
good afternoon it said in a small clear voice  
can I help you  
we were wondering if we could help you said Mrs Brown  
where ever have you come from  
the bear looked around carefully before replying  
darkest Peru  
I stowed away and lived on Marmalade  
Mrs Brown spired a label around the bear's neck  
it said simply please look after this bear  
thank you  
aunt Lucy  
Henry she exclaimed we shall hafta take him home with us  
but we don't even know his name began Mr Brown  
we'll call him 
Paddington said Mrs Brown  
because that's where we 
found him  
Mrs Brown went off to look Judy and Mr Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat  
he left Paddington sitting at a table in the corner near the window  
and he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of tea and a large plate piled high with 
sticky cakes  
after his long journey Paddington felt so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink  
I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mr Brown he announced  
and without waiting for a reply he climbed up on to the table  
Mr Brown steered out of the window pretending he had tea with a bear at Paddington station everyday of his life  
what's Paddington doing  
ohmygoodness  
he's standing on the table  
yikes  
when Mrs Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw her hands up with horror  
Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear  
he's covered all over with cream and jam  
oh is that the mommy  
that's Mrs Brown the mommy  
and there's the daddy  
and 
that's Judy right  
right  
at the sound of Mrs Brown's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea  
I think we better go before anything else happens said Mr Brown  
and quickly led the way out of the cafeteria  
Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it  
what's on Paddington's foot  
is that a cup  
ohmygoodness  
that is so messy  
come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi  
and you both can have a nice hot bath  
Paddington had never been in a taxi before  
do you remember what color the taxis are in New York  
in New York are they yellow  
yes  
he found it very exciting and stood on a lil tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people on the street  
oh that's okay sweetie  
you want that  
soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door  
when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack  
I haven't gotten very much said Paddington only some marmalade  
and my scrapbook  
and this sort of South American penny  
he held up a photograph and that's my aunt Lucy  
she had it taken right before she went into the home for retired bears  
what does that look like  
it looks like a dime  
I think it's a sort of penny  
it's a type of penny  
next Judy showed Paddington to the bathroom  
as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window  
then he tried writing his name on the steamy glass with his paw  
it took him rather a long time  
and when he looked around he found his surprise the bath was so full of water it started to run over the side  
oh no  
he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw  
he jumped in  
the water was hot soapy and very deep  
then to his horror he found he couldn't get out  
he couldn't even see to turn the taps off  
oh no  
Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder  
help help  
but still nobody came  
then he had an idea  
he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water  
downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington  
when suddenly she felt a plop  
looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling  
Paddington she called he must be in trouble  
quick  
and together they raced out of the room  
Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor  
what a mess said Jonathan  
we better wipe it up pretty quickly  
look at all that water on Paddington  
they took him out of the bath tub  
he's so wet isn't he  
yes  
Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat  
sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs  
settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire  
he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes  
it was nice being a bear  
especially a bear called Paddington  
he had a feeling that life with the Brown's was going to be 
fun  
okay  
does your eye feel better honey  
a lil bit better  
okay good

what's Corduroy holding  
oh Paddington's garden  
Paddington's garden  
one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens  
it was a long list and he had almost reached the end of the paper when he suddenly realized he left out one of the nicest things of all  
the garden itself  
wow that's nice  
Paddington liked the Brown's garden  
it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all  
but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work  
and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large  
what's that  
there's Mrs Brown she's the mommy  
and the daddy too  
it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own  
it will keep them out of mischief she said  
and will help you at the same time  
so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea  
early next morning all three set to work  
Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden  
but Paddington didn't know what to do  
gardening was much harder than it looked  
especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging  
in the end he decided to do some shopping  
oh look he's buying what's he buying  
seeds  
and he has a basket  
and the trowel  
and he's gonna buy a lil wheel barrel to  
it seemed very good value indeed  
especially since he had two pence left over  
the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished  
so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade  
Paddington set out to visit the near by building site  
by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning  
and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks  
and put down his jar of marmalade  
hm  
after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit  
Paddington decided to take a short walk instead  
when he got back his eyes nearly popped out  
a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade  
oh my  
at that moment the foreman came round and seen the look on Paddington's face  
he stopped to ask what was wrong  
oh my chunks have been buried he exclaimed hotly  
so they all set to work clearing the cement  
but there was no sign of Paddington's jar  
suddenly there was a worrying sound from over head  
a platform landed at his feet  
my marmalade he said  
I put it there ready for my tea break and it must have been taken out by mistake  
it was the foreman's turn to look as if he could hardly believe his eyes  
that's quick drying cement  
it's probably rock hard  
and no one will give me two pence for it now  
I will said Paddington  
and he took the lumps of concrete home  
and made a beautiful rockery  
there's his wheelbarrow  
and his concrete and his trowel  
concrete  
wheelbarrow  
trowel  
trowel  
and his seeds started to grow  
it fit so well with Jonathan's paved garden and Judy's flower bed it that it looked as if the whole thing had been planned  
and they celebrated by having tea in the new garden  
after it was over Paddington stayed on for a while in order to finish his list of all the nice things there were  
about being a bear and living at thirty two Winsor Gardens  
he had one more important item to add  
my rockery  
and signed his name and added his special paw print just to show that it was 
genuine  
genuine
