he does have a tail  
and where does Fredrick live  
in the book  
he does  
where does Fredrick and his family live  
do they live in the old stone wall  
oh  do we see an old stone wall while we were driving  
we did  
should we read Fredrick  
all along the meadow  
where the cows grazed and the horses ran  
was an old stone wall  
in that wall not far from the barn  
in the greenery  
he's half asleep  
you're right  
a chatty family of field mice had their home  
their home  
but the farmer's had moved away  
the barn was abandoned  
and the greenery stood empty  
he's half asleep Fredrick  
and since winter was not far off  
the lil mice began to gather corn  
and nuts and wheat and straw  
and they all worked day and night  
all except 
Fredrick right  
Fredrick why don't you work they asked  
I do work said Fredrick  
is Fredrick wiggling  
you're wiggling  
giggling  
hehe hehe hehe  
oh that's a wiggle alright  
whoa  
oh my gosh  Fredrick is quite the wiggler  
look what are the mice carrying  
corn  
staring at the meadow they said  and now Fredrick  
I gather colors answered Fredrick  
for winter is grey  
that's a lot of colors  
the phone is black  
once Fredrick seemed half asleep  
are you dreaming Fredrick they asked reproachfully  
but Fredrick said oh no  
I'm gathering words  for the winter days are long and many  
and we'll run out of things to say  
I caught Fredrick  
Fredrick  
ut  is that the lil mouse tushie  
what's his name  I don't know  
do you think we should come up with a name for him  
let's see  what if his name was  what's a good name for a mouse  
do you think  
um  
what about if his name was Harry  
no  
what if his name was um Matthew  
oh it's Steve  okay  
we'll call that  we'll call that mouse Steve  
and we can tell uncle Steve that there is a mouse named after him  
that would be a good idea  
winter days came and when the first snow fell  the five lil field mice took to their hide out in the stones  
is it snowing  
oo  did it snow here  
we got a lot of snow  a lil while ago  
right  
are they eating cookies  
in the beginning there was lots to eat  
and the mouses told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats  
and they were a happy family  
that's Steve  
he doesn't look so so happy  
I think he's hungry  
I think that's Fredrick  
oh gosh  
who do you think that is  
could that be Harvey  
that's Harvey okay  
and maybe that's Talula  
right  
and that could be  
Mazy okay  
good idea  
can you remember what Fredrick said about sun rays  
and colors and words  
what about your supplies Fredrick  
close your eyes said Fredrick  
now I send you the rays of the sun  
do you feel their golden glow  
and then he told them of the blue periwinkles  
and the red poppies  
and the yellow wheat  
and the green leaves on the berry bush  
they saw the colors as clearly as they saw as if they had been painted in their minds  
and the words Fredrick  
Fredrick cleared his throat  
waited a moment  
and then as if from a stage  
said  wanna hear Fredrick's poem  
who scatters the snowflakes  
who melts the ice  
who spoils the weather  
who makes it nice  
who grows the four leaf clover in June  
who dims the day light  
who lights the moon  
four lil field mice who live in the sky  
four lil field mice like you and I  
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers  
then comes in the summer who paints in the flowers  
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat  
and winter is last with lil cold feet  
aren't we lucky the seasons are four  
think of a year with one less or one more  
when Fredrick had finished they all applauded  
but Fredrick they said  you are a poet  
Fredrick blushed  
and took a bow  
I know that's how we made Fredrick  
right  
yeah  
they put lil eyes and ears on Fredrick  
those are his ears  
and his tail  
and his lil eyes and nose  
and his tail too  
hee hee hee hee  
hee hee hee hee  
your Fredrick  
oh let me try and straighten him out  
do you wanna sing your a b c song honey  
you wanna sing your a b c song  
yay  very good  
very good honey  
and you even got your e in there

you wanna read Horton  
do you love Horton  
you want mommy to go upstairs and get baby elephant  
read the book first and then I'll get baby elephant  
okay I'll get baby elephant  
oh my gosh  
where do you think baby elephant is  
I'll go get baby elephant  
you think baby elephant needs to read Horton  
cause Horton's an elephant too  
okay  
you gonna sit with baby elephant  
okay  
Horton hatches the egg  
sighed Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg  
I'm tired  and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg  
from sitting  just sitting here day after day  
it's work  how I hate it  I'd much rather play  
I'd take a vacation  
fly off for a rest  
if I could find someone to stay on my 
nest  
if I could fins someone I'd fly away free  
then Horton the elephant passed by her tree  
hello said the lazy bird  smiling her best  
she has a tail  you're right  
you're right  Horton's got a tail too  
right Horton's tail is white and Mazy's is red  
wow  
wow  
hee hee hee  
you have nothing to do and I do need a rest  
would you like to sit on the egg on my nest  
uh oh  did baby elephant fall down  
and you fell down too  
you're silly  
I don't think it's so comfy to lie on your backpack right  
and then I'll hafta tickle you  
okay can we read our book and then go get blankie  
no let's keep our sweater on sweetie  
you with your pretty buttons  
oy  
should we finish Horton or should I put him away  
alright  
bye bye Horton  
the elephant laughed  
of all silly things  
I haven't feathers and I haven't wings  
me on our egg  
why that doesn't make sense  
your egg is so small mam  
immense  
tut tut  answered Mazy  
I know you're not small  
but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all  
just sit on it softly  
you're gentle and kind  
sweet stuff  I'm not done with that page  
do you want to finish the page  
I can't said the elephant  
please begged the bird  
I won't be gone long  I give you my word  
I'll hurry right back I'll never be missed  
very well said the elephant  
since you insist  
you want a vacation  
go fly off and take it  
I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it  
hm  the first thing to do murmured Horton  let's see  
first thing to do is to prop up this tree  
and make it much stronger that has to be done  
before I get on  I must weigh a 
a ton  
then Horton the elephant smiled  
now that's that  
and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat  
it's raining  
it's raining very hard  isn't it  
through a terrible storm  
and it poured and it lightning  
it thundered and rumbled  
this isn't much fun  the elephant grumbled  
but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach  
enjoying the sunshine  way off in Palm Beach  
and having such fun  such a wonderful rest  
decided she'd never go back to her nest  
oh no  
there's snow all over Horton  
so Horton kept sitting there day after day  
and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away  
and then came the winter  
the snow and the sleet  
and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet  
he's all clean now  
and then came spring time with troubles anew  
his friends gathered round and shouted with glee  
look Horton the elephant is up in a tree  
they taunted and teased him and said how absurd  
old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird  
no matter what happens this egg must be tended  
they are wearing suits  
black eyes right  
three hunters came up softly from behind  
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start  
three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart  
did he run  
Horton stayed on that nest  
held his head high  
and threw out his chest  
and he looked at the hunters as much as to say  
shoot if you must but I won't run away  
but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise  
they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes  
hm  
yeah that's one of the hunters  
with ropes on front for the pullers to drag on  
and dug up his tree and put it inside  
with Horton so sad he practically cried  
up out of the jungle up into the sky  
is that a baby elephant  
then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant  
with nest and tree  
he's pushing that cart  
he's swimming you're right  
Horton  Horton is on a ship  
right  
red boat or a yellow boat  
out of the wagon and onto a ship  
over the ocean and oh what a trip  
rolling and tossing and splash with the spray  
and Horton said day after day after day  
I meant what I said and I said what I meant  
but oh am I sea sick  
one hundred percent  
they landed at last in the town of 
New York  
all a shore the men shouted and down with a lurch  
and Horton the elephant still on his perch  
tied on to a board that could just scarcely hold him  
bump Horton landed and then the men sold him  
he's selling tickets  
he's selling tickets  
those are red tickets  
you buy a ticket and then your allowed to go into the show  
then one day the circus show happened to reach  a town way down south not far from Palm Beach  
and dawdling along way up high in the sky  
who of all people should chance to fly by  
but that old good for nothing bird  run away Mazy  
still on vacation and still just as lazy  
and she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door  
good gracious gasped Mazy  I've seen you before  
poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk  
he started to speak but before he could talk  
they rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg he had sat on for fifty one weeks  
a thumping a bumping a wild alive scratching  
my egg shouted Horton my egg  
a baby is gonna come out of the egg  
it's mice she sputtered  you stole it from me  
get off of my nest and out of my tree  
there's the baby  
the baby came out of the egg  
it had ears and a tail and a trunk just like his  
and the people came shouting what's all this about  
oh that Mazy bird is mad  
oh  
it should be it should be it should be like that  
because Horton was faithful  he sat and he sat  
he meant what he said  
and said what I meant  
and they sent him home happy  
does baby elephant like that book
