oh you still gonna poop . 
Gospal in the hospital . 
okay . 
I did . 
I put a new batch of laundry in . 
I think he's done pooping . 
he's done so he's just gonna sit in my lap and read . 
well when you put yours in the potty you can pretend you put his in too . 
hm: oh that must be the hospital building . 
that's what that is . 
mm what's that ? 
where ? 
and what's that ? 
here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air . 
Gospal in the hospital . 
last year I was Gospal the dog walker . 
when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs . 
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me . 
a key chain with a little . 
what ? 
race car yes . 
what's this thing ? 
a ramp . 
hm: I thought it might be Gospal's shadow . 
well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it . 
ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow . 
every one at school wanted [: wanted] it but it was mine . 
I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my +//. 
mouth oh oh . 
what blue thing ? 
that's the bench that they're sitting on . 
what do you think the teacher is trying to do ? 
the teacher called an ambulance . 
there it is . 
the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell . 
they just know that he's very sick . 
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth . 
I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here ? 
mhm . 
not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room . 
that's the special water going into patient's body . 
you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember ? 
okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself . 
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me . 
don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt . 
but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x-ray room . 
do you remember getting x_rays ? 
you might not remember you did get x_rays couple of times . 
that's his x-ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there . 
poor little guy ah . 
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said . 
can you count ? 
one . 
I'm reading the story . 
I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver xxx . 
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night . 
my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big +//. 
I think you're right . 
inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it . 
again . 
you do ? 
did you do more poop in there ? 
can I look ? 
you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty . 
maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home . 
well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic . 
why don't we give Daddy a call . 
that's to tell people how much the book cost . 
you need your hair elastic fixed . 
that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book . 
hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight ? 
we could do that . 
yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time . 
alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty . 
I don't think you're peeing or pooping are you ? 
ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital . 
last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs . 
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me . 
did he buy dog food ? 
no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar ? 
hm: did he ? 
did he buy a tricycle ? 
oh a key chain with a little race car . 
everyone at school wanted it but it was mine . 
he's in school he's an animal who goes to school . 
I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key+chain in my mouth . 
but gulp oh no I swallowed it . 
I think he did gulp it . 
oh you think he chewed it . 
oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though . 
suddenly I felt very sick . 
he really doesn't feel well . 
what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key+chain . 
I think he's [= he] may be embarrassed . 
well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key+chain . 
she called an ambulance . 
the ambulance put me on a stretcher . 
this is the stretcher . 
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell . 
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key+chain in my mouth . 
well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much . 
they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people . 
see there he's on the stretcher they're carrying him in . 
this is the special water . 
it's a i_v fluid . 
called i_v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it . 
that's the patient's bed . 
yes I think you're right . 
the people who go to the hospital usually are sick . 
I was a little scared , that's what this page says . 
they saw what I swallowed . 
well it's no fun to be in the hospital . 
they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna [: going to] go in and take the key+chain out of his belly . 
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver xxx . 
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night . 
my parents were right there what's that ? 
it's a great big package . 
it could be a bath tub . 
it could be an apple tree . 
you're probably right . 
it could be ten pairs of pants . 
what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story . 
and I think it's time .
