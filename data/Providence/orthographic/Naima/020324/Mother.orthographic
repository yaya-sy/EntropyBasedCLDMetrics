it's our new play group . 
did you say bye to Daddy ? 
he wasn't at work when he was going that way ? 
that's right . 
have a good day , don't drink too much coffee ! 
well , sort of a joke . 
sort of . 
you can see his new car , you've never watched him drive away in his new car . 
you've only watched him drive away in his old car . 
he's waving to you ! 
(be)cause he's waving byebye ! 
baddy , baddy , baddy , baddy ? 
is that his name ? 
oh , that's his new car . 
he's driving his new car away . 
it sounds different , doesn't it ? 
it has a different noise than the old car . 
byebye Daddy with his new car ! 
what this ? 
or this ? 
or this ? 
oh this ? 
that's a clothes+pin . 
it's a special kind of magnet clothes+pin . 
did you like using clothes+pins this morning ? 
that was fun . 
we could actually bring a few to &-uhhh xxx and , I mean rather to &-uhhh +... 
xxx and xxx house this morning so you can keep practicing . 
would you like to do that ? 
we could bring some doll clothes and you could hang them . 
I dunno [: don't know] if xxx has legos . 
you wanna see what his toys look like ? 
yeah , he might have some interesting toys . 
he's a little toddler but he still might have some toys that are fun to play with , but I do think we should bring our own toys . 
well , because I don't know for sure if his toys are gonna [: going to] be fun to play with because he's littler than you . 
because he is sixteen months old ! 
and you are , how many months are you now ? 
let's see , is this June , July ? 
March , April , May , June , July +... 
so , sixteen weeks plus twenty +... 
you are twenty eight months old Naima . 
you're twenty , almost twenty eight months old and xxx is sixteen months old . 
I'm gonna bring some grapes to play+group . 
oh that would be very interesting , I wonder what his high+chair looks like . 
well , we're not going to xxx house . 
xxx and xxx and xxx are probably going to come to xxx house just like we are . 
we're going to xxx and xxx house . 
yeah , we could ask xxx to show us . 
we could ask xxx to show us . 
and you know what , they live near the South Yarmouth library . 
where we used to go . 
to listen to stories . 
remember xxx who used to be there , the librarian ? 
do you remember her ? 
she used to sing welcome welcome everyone , now you're here we'll have some fun ! 
xxx used to be in that story group . 
library group . 
remember that ? 
yeah , when you were a littler , but you weren't really , well you were a baby when you started +... 
but then you were a little toddler when we still used to go there . 
you used to do trot trot to Boston , trot trot to xxx , you better watch out or you might fall in ! 
remember doing that ? 
and you used to do it with xxx sometimes too . 
let's see +... 
and who else was in that library group , do you remember the other +... 
when you were a bigger toddler ? 
or when you were a little toddler ? 
you're a big toddler now . 
well +... 
you did go to a toddler group after we stopped going to that library group . 
where Jane used to come and read stories and then there was a craft . 
you did that a couple of times . 
there were a lot of children there , do you remember ? 
I don't remember , we only went to that twice I think . 
so I didn't really learn their names . 
if we have time we could go to the South Yarmouth Library after our play group and see if they have the Bear Family book and check it out . 
would you like to do that ? 
I thought so . 
Waldo is in that book . 
is Waldo the Grandpa bear ? 
maybe you're right . 
I thought he was , I thought he was Uncle Waldo . 
you want some more grape ? 
with a towel ? 
do you think bears use towels ? 
I think they might just shake themselves off likes dogs do . 
(be)cause it's easier than having to have a towel . 
they do what ? 
what do bears do ? 
bear potties ? 
bear parties ? 
or bear potties ? 
which ? 
bear parties ? 
bear potties ? 
oh . 
bears actually don't use potties at all , do they ? 
they just poop in the forest . 
and the baby bear poops in the forest too . 
or in the meadow . 
animals don't use potties , except cats who live in the house use &-uhhh cat potties . 
yup [: yes] . 
&-um: I don't think that animals do , that's a rule for people . 
that they need to wash their hands when they poop or pee . 
after they poop or pee . 
well animals don't usually do that , although cats and some animals do clean themselves up after they poop or pee in the potty . 
I am looking for +... 
oh there's pictures of pee_pee and poop in that , animal pee_pee and poop . 
well you tell me , what do oops +... 
something came tumbling out of the freezer (be)cause our freezer has so much junk in it . 
I might pack some other lunch things for you because if we have lunch with Daddy then we'll need to have more stuff . 
you spilled some milk just now ? 
oh okay , that's not a big deal . 
I'm not worried about it . 
I'm gonna clean it up anyway . 
this cheese that I'm gonna pack up for +... 
no not for xxx , for you to eat either at snack+time or lunch+time .

cheddar cheese . 
which you like . 
it's called cheddar cheese . 
it is sharp cheddar cheese . 
it's organic sharp cheddar cheese .

I think you're ready to get out of the chair now , aren't you ? 
well , I don't really like having ants in my kitchen . 
well I just don't . 
I don't like having insects in my kitchen very much . 
well a kitchen is a place that needs to be kept clean and most insects are not very clean . 
okay sweetie+pie girl . 
oh okay , Sweetie_Bear .

you mean the butter ? 
does the butter taste bad to you ? 
oh , sorry to hear that .

you're gonna ask his mommy ? 
mm (o)kay , I think we'll start this up again later that was just seventeen minutes on Wednesday , July ninth . 
oh I think there is a picture where there are children at a play+ground . 
is it the top first picture ? 
I think it's that first picture right there . 
are they at a play+ground ? 
looks like they're on a , they're playing on swings . 
what else are those children doing ? 
should we add some words to these books ? 
we could write some words . 
oh , do you remember who made these books ? 
yes , we did . 
why are they home+made books ? 
(be)cause we made them at home . 
we need to snap these . 
get these snapped . 
is that in your way ? 
let me adjust it a little for you . 
well I'd kinda [: kind of] like to leave it on you for just a little while while we're taping . 
recording . 
let's keep lookin(g) at the books . 
what do we see here ? 
should we write the names of these animals in the book ? 
I guess we need either a crayon or a magic marker to do that . 
you wanna learn how to write ? 
because why ? 
oh , you don't ? 
I see . 
let's see if I can get this off . 
a boogie+board ? 
was there a girl with a boogie+board at the beach ? 
I thought we were gonna go get magic markers so that we could write words in those books that we made yesterday . 
you're gonna learn how to write , okay ! 
okay . 
&-uhhh , oh let's get the magic marker . 
you know we could use crayons . 
why are you upset ? 
yes , I'm getting the magic markers ! 
you want some paper ? 
alright ? 
should we write down +... 
you want some crayons , okay . 
crayons are good . 
you don't want what ? 
okay , I'll put the markers away . 
take all these crayons with us to the living room . 
a piece of what ? 
yeah , this is paper right here . 
yeah , there are ants in the kitchen . 
I don't like ants in my kitchen , okay . 
so , here's some crayons . 
and you want to learn how to write some words you said ? 
you want me to write the words ? 
well , I could write them and you could practice . 
practicing is good too . 
that's a yellow crayon . 
isn't it ? 
oh , you're taking that page out ? 
okay . 
alright . 
well you can still write on it though , look it's good to write on . 
why don't you write on that ? 
well you need to write on a hard surface like this . 
that's a nice hard surface and you could put here , you could put this down . 
you could draw on that one . 
what color &-um: crayons should I use to write the names of the animals ? 
okay , orange . 
should I write eagle here ? 
you can just leave that alone , okay ? 
just leave it alone , just ignore it . 
that means don't pay attention . 
okay , I'm gonna write +... 
eagle right here . 
do you know how to spell eagle ? 
you wanna practice writing ? 
e@l a@l g@l l@l e@l ! 
oh see it ? 
or you wanna practice ? 
using the clothes+pins now ? 
looks like you're using the clothes+pins . 
yup [: yes] , we can do this later when +... 
oh , did that clothes+pin break ? 
alright , I'll see if I can fix that . 
well it's broken right , so why don't you give it to me and I'll see if I can put it back together . 
okay . 
you didn't think it was delicate I think . 
but it was a little bit delicate . 
okay . 
what are you doing ? 
you're putting clothes+pins there ? 
how (a)bout putting them on this side now ? 
hm: . 
it's not easy , is it ? 
you did it , there ! 
should we do it together ? 
I think that's the other part why don't you give that one to me . 
remember , push and clip . 
push . 
push . 
and clip . 
it's not easy on that side , when it's on that side ? 
I think you're doing a pretty good job actually . 
hm: , there that one's fixed . 
which fingers am I using ? 
that's right . 
mhm . 
I like these new clothes+pins , they're so +... 
new and clean and they're in these nice colors . 
blue and white . 
hello . 
hello . 
it's like a mouth . 
that end of the clothes+pin looks like an animals mouth , like a crocodile . 
squeak ! 
squeak squeak squeak ! 
do you wanna try hanging up the dolls clothes with the clothes+pins ? 
on a +... 
I'm trying to think +... 
what we could use a clothes , make a little clothes+line in the house . 
oh , do you know how to take them off ? 
you squeeze them again when you get them off . 
you squeeze with your fingers , index or thumb . 
watch Mommy do it . 
watch . 
squeeze . 
squeeze when it comes off . 
squeeze and open when you take it off . 
can you practice taking it off too ? 
squeeze . 
and open , yeah . 
squeeze and open . 
squeeze , open , pull up . 
squeeze , open , pull up . 
one at a time , one at a time it's easier . 
watch Mommy do it . 
squeeze , open , pull up . 
you hafta squeeze at the top , right up here . 
squeeze , there . 
okay , I'm just trying to think whether we have anything like a clothes+line in the house . 
oh I know , we have that twine that I was using for the garden . 
how (a)bout if I get that ? 
where can we tie it here in the living room ? 
because I don't want you to step on it . 
really ? 
you do like to step on your pony , why do you like to step on your pony ? 
(be)cause he's mad ? 
do you do that when you're feeling mad ? 
why is Naima crying ? 
the what ? 
the twine , yeah . 
I'm just trying to think where we're gonna put the twine . 
how about +... 
oh you know , we could do it over there at the fire+place if we clean the toys away a little bit . 
lemme [: let me] get a big piece of twine . 
okay . 
let's a , let's clip that on to you . 
actually you know what , you have a great little pocket . 
you can put it right there in the +... 
hey , I think that's the garbage truck . 
do you wanna see it ? 
okay . 
let's go see . 
oh here I'll lift you up . 
here it is . 
what color is it ? 
blue ? 
it looks black to me . 
what color lights does it have ? 
yeah . 
there he is ! 
yes . 
it's a big truck ! 
yay ! 
he's very strong . 
byebye garbage truck ! 
byebye . 
the truck takes the garbage to the dump . 
okay . 
there's water in the dump+truck ? 
oh , you're talking about your toy dump+truck ? 
the twine is right here . 
and I'm going to put the clothes+line for the doll clothes right here . 
yup [: yes] , and we hafta clean the toys up so that you can stand there and hang those . 
clothes with the clothes+pins . 
I'm gonna help you do that . 
in just a second . 
oh let's clean them up in a nice neat way though , okay ? 
I don't want just everything dumped in the living room , ouch ! 
(be)cause I hit my foot , that's why . 
yes , thank you . 
you're right . 
I do like a nice neat room , oh I see what you're doing ! 
you're straightening up . 
for Daddy to stand ? 
for you to stand . 
where is , yeah . 
now the other thing we need to do is to find the &-uhhh +... 
doll clothes . 
why don't you put these things &-um: +... 
over where the +... 
here this too . 
where the tool box is . 
that's where those things belong . 
they belong with the tool+box . 
well , we're straightening up so that you have room . 
to put the +... 
yeah . 
can you just , why don't you practice by just putting a clothes+pin on that line . 
can you do that ? 
do it the same way you do it on the box , you hafta hold the top of the clothes+pin . 
push . 
and then clip . 
can I show you ? 
okay watch my fingers , push ! 
okay , the way you take it off +... 
push ! 
and there . 
find the doll clothes , you need to find them before you hang them up . 
here's something to hang up . 
where are the rest of the doll clothes ? 
for hanging up . 
seems to me you need to find some more . 
okay , this is what we're gonna do . 
put it here and now you can push . 
just like you did it on the box the same way , but you hafta point it down . 
it's upside down . 
okay watch Mommy do it . 
push . 
and clip . 
and this is gonna move but that's okay . 
it doesn't matter . 
put it up right ? 
we can't put it up right because the twine is too small . 
if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think . 
oh yeah ? 
do you wanna get some more doll clothes and hang them up to dry ? 
why don't you look in your room and see if there's some in there ? 
hey look what I found under the lego table ! 
okay . 
this is tricky , you gotta hold that with one hand . 
and hold the clothes+pin with your other hand . 
want me to hold the clothes up for you ? 
yeah , you were doing a good job . 
okay . 
push a little more on the top of the clothes+pin . 
you wanna do it on the floor ? 
you know you can hang the clothes up right on the box where you've been putting the clothes+pins . 
take the clothes over to the box . 
let me have it . 
I wanna show you . 
you don't want me to show you ? 
oh okay . 
I could show you and then you could try it after I do it . 
that's how you learn things . 
I see . 
what happened ? 
what happened ? 
the other +... 
yeah , the other hair clip . 
the green one is in your hair . 
this one . 
you had both of them in your hair . 
I'm getting your hair outta [: out of] your eyes , that's good it'll make it easier to play . 
do you wanna have a snack ? 
want some grapes ? 
you're gonna go in the tunnel , okay . 
well , I'm gonna straighten up a little bit here . 
do you wanna write the words in the book with me ? 
oh I see . 
are we in a bad mood now ? 
do you want some snack bar ? 
cherries ? 
are you feeling upset ? 
why don't you have a bottle of milk or something ? 
you want a bottle of cow's milk ? 
grape juice ? 
apple juice ? 
&-uhhh cookie ? 
alphabet cookie ? 
hummus ? 
frozen banana ? 
you could have frozen banana . 
nursies want to rest . 
how (a)bout count to ten nursie ? 
count to six nursie . 
somebody else nursie ? 
it's okay to do count to ten nursie . 
then you need to have some . 
and then you can have some +... 
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten . 
six . 
alright six , six more and that's it . 
okay . 
okay . 
poor you , poor you . 
alright . 
okay . 
baby yogurt , no ? 
I think a little food would be a good idea . 
it willn't [= won't] , it won't be good ? 
how (a)bout some smoothie ? 
oh alright , you want me to read that while you're eating and drinking ? 
we could do that . 
then we'll come back and straighten up the living room . 
right , why don't you pick something out of the refrigerator ? 
alright , do you want baby yogurt , (be)cause it's way in the back somewhere ? 
oh okay , what do you want ? 
tofu ? 
these are the grapes . 
and there's cheese . 
and hummus . 
and there's &-uhhh wheat shreds . 
that's milk . 
okay , hummus to eat . 
smoothie to drink ! 
you got it . 
you got it ! 
it is snack time anyway . 
it certainly is snack time . 
it is . 
we need to buy more smoothie , remember we went to the store yesterday and they didn't have the right kind of smoothie ! 
they just didn't . 
that store doesn't carry that kind of smoothie , I was very disappointed . 
yeah , there is a picture of a cow right there . 
that's what cows say ? 
bah and gah ? 
are you sure that's what cows say ? 
really ? 
I don't think so . 
I think cows say moo . 
they don't ? 
cows say bah , that's a good joke ! 
snow sled ? 
quite a long time ago ? 
oh . 
yeah , we did buy a snow sled at the toy store . 
that was a long time ago . 
who wants to play in the snow with that ? 
well if it snows I'll definitely give you that to play with . 
I'm gonna give you a smoothie . 
smoothie . 
let's put it in here . 
you want a paper cup ? 
alright . 
you better use both hands . 
are you gonna have the hummus too ? 
it's Mommy Day today ? 
I didn't know it was Mommy Day . 
use both hands with that . 
Mommy Day ? 
hm: . 
do you wanna [: want a] little cracker with your hummus or are you just gonna just use the spoon ? 
okay I think , you wanna try this kinda [: kind of] cracker ? 
Akmak . 
with sesame seeds on it . 
mm . 
crunchy and good . 
Akmak . 
that's the kinda [: kind of] crackers they are . 
Akmak . 
Akmak . 
oh , I heard a birdie ! 
I thought it was a vulture ? 
actually , I didn't think that was a vulture . 
it doesn't sound like a vulture , I'm gonna drink some orange juice . 
while you're having your snack . 
yeah , (be)cause I'm thirsty . 
that's exactly what I was doing ! 
how did you know that ? 
&-um: , what does the police+man say to Corduroy ? 
he says how did you get up here ? 
why does he say that ? 
yeah , Corduroy went up the escalator all by himself ! 
that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself . 
(be)cause bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark . 
they might get lost ! 
he did get a little bit lost , didn't he ? 
he was trying to look for the button . 
&-um: , because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons , they want bears who already have their buttons . 
let's see here +... 
wow , you polished that right up didn't you ? 
hungry girl ! 
here's a bit more ! 
oh boy ! 
want some more akh@s:pan makh@s:pan too ? 
you like that , huh ? 
that's how the akh@s:pan makh@s:pan is made . 
it's made with sesame seeds on it . 
that's just how it's made . 
did you have fun this morning ? 
where did we go ? 
do you remember ? 
whose house did we go to ? 
xxx house . 
that was fun . 
and you wanted to see what his high+chair looked like . 
and you saw it . 
looks like a restaurant high+chair , doesn't it ? 
it looks the same kinda [: kind of] restaurant , &-um: high+chair that restaurants usually use . 
well he has one that's like a restaurant high+chair , but he uses it at home . 
what did you say ? 
you're interesting ? 
mhm . 
akh@s:pan makh@s:pan , yes . 
more smoothie ? 
smoothie . 
smoothie . 
you're helping me , okay . 
you've never seen what ? 
you've never seen a Mommy duckling kissing her mommy duck ? 
you've never seen a duckling hug her Mommy . 
why ? 
what do ducks eat ? 
I think they eat little plants that grow in the water . 
mostly . 
I dunno [: don't know] if ducks eat insects , I'd like to find out . 
I think we should find out . 
maybe I'll write that , we have a list of questions on the board . 
and one would be do ducks , what do ducks eat ? 
that's a very good question . 
I will write it down on our question sheet right now . 
our list of questions . 
what do ducks eat ? 
I dunno [: don't know] , I'm gonna find out for you . 
they live near the water . 
I think they drink water from ponds , or lakes or +... 
oh . 
just from lakes . 
I think we should go to Cape Cod Natural Foods . 
so that we can buy more smoothie . 
because +... 
(be)cause +... 
we're out , almost out of smoothie . 
you're about to , you're about to finish . 
the last smoothie . 
and we also need some +... 
&-uhhh canola oil . 
and fish sticks . 
yeah . 
you wanna eat , drink some more ? 
there's a little bit left . 
let's see +... 
yeah , okay . 
that's the end of it though . 
all gone . 
it's all gone ! 
well , how (a)bout drinking more smoothie ? 
I heard you say that . 
but &-uh a smoothie is for drinking , not for washing . 
it just is . 
okay , Mommy's gonna make chili tonight . 
to eat , chili is a food we eat , it's spicy beans . 
what ? 
you're a silly+willy ? 
who's a silly+willy ? 
mhm , I'm cutting . 
hot peppers here . 
I'm gonna freeze these hot peppers . 
to use later , or maybe I'll +... 
use a little more of them now . 
I'm cutting those hot peppers . 
well , they're very very hot and spicy so I don't wanna +... 
cause you to sneeze excessively . 
there we go . 
we're gonna put these in the freezer . 
say excuse me . 
you burped and it's good manners to say excuse me when you burp . 
yeah . 
excuse me . 
it's empty . 
okay . 
no smoothie in there . 
there is ? 
I thought it was all gone . 
dripping it . 
no smoothie . 
you still eating your hummus or are you finished with it ? 
oh , okay . 
what is that cracker called ? 
remember ? 
well , I am still drinking it . 
(be)cause it's thirsty , I'm thirsty . 
and I +... 
wanna keep healthy . 
I'm not eating anything right now . 
I'm just drinking orange juice . 
there's no Daddy downstairs . 
you know where he is and what he's doing I think . 
yeah . 
he's gonna help people feel better . 
patients . 
what do you think ? 
you know the answer to that question . 
he's gonna check their hearts , oops . 
well , I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down . 
some time ago , perhaps . 
there . 
he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope . 
what else does he do to help them feel better Naima ? 
he looks in their ears with an otoscope ? 
I don't think he does that a lot , but I think once in a while maybe he does that . 
he figures out what kind of medicine they need . 
I'm cooking onions and garlic . 
and green hot spicy peppers . 
(be)cause I'm making chili . 
and chili's also gonna have black beans in it . 
and tomatoes . 
and we're gonna eat it for supper later on . 
you'll have chili . 
well right now it's just onions , it's not that interesting . 
but +... 
when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it . 
your hand's [: hand is] going away ? 
oh , it's very dark outside isn't it ? 
you think it's gonna snow or rain ? 
it doesn't really snow in the summer . 
just summer is not a time when there's snow . 
winter , fall and spring are the only time when it snows . 
&-uhhh xxx house . 
what was he doing there ?
