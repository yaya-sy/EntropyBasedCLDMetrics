and (.) did we read this one yet ? 
that's called Baby Bears and How They Grow . 
and xxx Baby and xxx .

I think that Oil Spill is the one I was thinking of . 
it's about an oil spill . 
do you wanna sit in the bed and read that together ? 
okay . 
mhm . 
well there's a certain kind of oil spill that happens (.) when oil being carried , lots a big amount of oil being carried by a boat , &-uh has an accident and spills out accidentally . 
and that causes problems for animals , when that happens . 
oh , and we haven't read that , called Snowy Owl . 
is that a beaver or an otter ? 
mm , that's a problem . 
poor little otter . 
well , we're gonna read about that . 
xxx into the bed and do some reading , unless you wanna read in the rocking chair . 
Naima , I'll be right back . 
well , oil spills aren't good for animals . 
all kinds of problems +... 
no . 
people can't be swimming in the water when there's an oil spill . 
you'd get sick from that . 
cause it's not good to swim where there's +... 
come sit here next to me . 
get comfy . 
have a seat . 
but let's [: let us] find out what it , where it lives and what it's doing and what happens to it . 
this is called Oil Spill . 
I'm not even sure what kind of animal that is . 
mm oil spills happen when big , big , big boats like this that are carrying crude , it's called crude , oil from one country to another have an accident of some kind and they spill their oil into the ocean . 
that doesn't happen very often , but when it happens , it's not a good thing . 
okay , and this is actually the story of an oil spill that really happened a while ago . 
the night of March twenty fourth , nineteen eighty nine , was dark and cold . 
a huge black oil tanker glided out of the port of Valdez , Alaska . 
painted on its bow was its name , Exxon_Valdez . 
the bow of the boat is this part , kind_of like the front . 
the Exxon_Valdez floated low in the water . 
the huge tanker slowly sailed out into Prince William Sound . 
and then , suddenly , it happened . 
thick , black oil flowed out of the Exxon Valdez's smashed tanks . 
it poured into the dark water . 
the Exxon_Valdez spilled out , out eleven million gallons of oil . 
this is a picture of Alaska , Naima . 
this is a map of Alaska right here . 
this is where that oil spill happened , this part of Alaska . 
are you cold ? 
you're uncomfortable ? 
the sticky oil soon covered eleven thousand square miles of ocean water . 
okay , let's skip ahead and see +//. 
the birds couldn't swim or fly . 
some of them died . 
oil got into the bodies of fish , shrimp , and crabs . 
no one knows how many of them were killed . 
sea otters , sea+lions , harbor seals , and killer whales swallowed oil . 
they breathed the poisonous fumes . 
these animals got very sick also . 
hey , that's a (.) sea+lion I think . 
do you remember we saw sea lions ? 
because it spilled out of the boat . 
oil spills have many causes . 
some are accidents . 
like a tanker like the Exxon_Valdez runs aground , or collides with another ship . 
workers can make mistakes . 
or an undersea oil well starts to lea(k) , leak . 
or a pipe can break . 
the oil spreads out . 
it floats on top of the water . 
experts on oil spills rush to the scene . 
the first job is to stop the oil from spreading . 
they put a boom around the spill . 
it keeps the oil in one place . 
this is the boom . 
it's usually made out of different things . 
for small spills , the experts may call for a skimmer . 
there are several kinds of skimmers . 
it sucks up the oil from the water . 
sometimes the oil the skimmer collects can be used again . 
for some small spills , experts place special pads on top of the oil . 
the pads are like sponges . 
they soak up the oil , then they hafta get rid of the soaked up oil . 
for larger spills , the experts may set the oil on fire . 
clean up crews also use chemicals to get rid of large oil spills . 
other chemicals make the oil come together . 
the oil forms a layer like a sheet of rubber . 
one type of skimmer , I guess this is the skimmer machine , lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris , that means garbage , out of the water . 
oh , what kind of animals are these ? 
puffins ! 
sometimes , the experts decide that no action is the best way to treat an oil spill . 
the wind and waves mix the oil and water together . 
it is like mixing oil and vinegar to make salad dressing ! 
in time , much of the oil disappears . 
oil spills are major disasters . 
slowly , scientists are learning how to clean them up . 
they are learning how to prevent spills . 
how can we help to prevent oil spills ? 
that's a good question . 
if we use less oil , there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans . 
then the chance of oil spills will not be as great . 
one way +//. 
one way to save oil is to use less (.) electricity ! 
did you know that oil and electricity are related ? 
electricity is often produced by burning oil . 
less electricity means less oil and less risk of an oil spill . 
because sometimes power plants burn oil to make electricity that comes through the electric lines into our house . 
another way to cut oil needs is to use less gasoline , which is made from oil . 
gasoline is made from oil . 
that means driving smaller cars and staying within the speed limit . 
hm: . 
oh , there's a child who wrote a letter to someone in the government . 
and drew pictures of sea animals . 
wow , and look at the other books in this series . 
let's [: let us] see , this is a stage two book . 
this book is called Be A Friend to Trees . 
this book is called Dinosaurs Are Different . 
this book is called Where Does the Garbage Go . 
that would be a good book to get . 
that's called The Planets in Our Solar System . 
xxx . 
trees are good for the earth and good for people and good for animals . 
so you need to be good to trees . 
mm , that's someone who's helping to clean up an oil spill showing what the oil looks like . 
that's a different kind of oil +... 
oh . 
that's a really hard job . 
I'm gonna wash it off with a special scrub brush and some special water . 
xxx . 
here's some +//. 
hello mother hen . 
she fell into an oil spill area . 
yes , breathing oil . 
there were fumes . 
you may have your chicken , chick back and take her home if you like . 
he's a wing baby ? 
do you have other chicks at home in your family ? 
well , I hope none of them got stuck in the oil spill . 
oh . 
huh .

what can we do to help the cat feel better now ?

for oil , how interesting . 
you probably do need to do that before you go home . 
and rescuing my cat . 
are you going home now ? 
that's good . 
are you tired when you get home , Naima ? 
from that kind of a job ? 
I bet you just crawl into bed after a job like that . 
mm . 
when you've worked really hard , it's good to rest . 
do you know that rocking in a chair is kind of like pumping in a swing ? 
(be)cause you're using your leg muscles . 
hey , who's that ? 
xxx .

we're taping , Daddy . 
maybe he could do that for you . 
well , you gotta start . 
okay . 
than the cooking oil we use downstairs . 
what kinds of oil do we eat ? 
we don't eat oil that looks like that , do we ? 
this is a very different type of oil . 
well any kind of oil that's not an edible oil is bad to eat . 
what kind of oil is okay to eat , Naima ? 
when I cook something on the stove , what do I sometimes fry it in ? 
yeah , olive oil , right ? 
in a restaurant sometimes , and even at home . 
and peanut oil .

xxx , luckily my car got fixed . 
let's [: let us] see what kind of , other kind of +//. 
oil is used in paint , some kinds of paint , to paint (.) walls and houses and furniture and things like that . 
okay . 
how bout [: about] if I attach this here ? 
you wanna take that off ? 
why don't we get one of your stuffed animals to be and animal in the ocean when the oil spills ? 
okay , this is my vacation house . 
okay , cats don't like water , do they . 
oh , is there gonna be any other animal ? 
okay , Motorcycle_Chicken will be in the water . 
you want +//?

okay . 
okay . 
what's that black stuff ? 
it's an oil spill !

uhoh . 
I better call the oil spill experts . 
well I'm calling to report an oil spill in xxx in Johnson Bay . 
we're in xxx and this is Johnson Bay and we see oil in the ocean . 
there's at least one duck , and there could be others that I can't see from my window . 
thank you . 
oh , good . 
mm . 
I hope you have gloves on to clean up the oil . 
I think it's gonna take them a couple of weeks to finish that job . 
xxx . 
mm , maybe we should offer those workers a cup of of coffee or tea , so they can have their break . 
xxx . 
hello , mam [: madam] ? 
have a seat . 
would you like tea or coffee ? 
what kind of tea would you like ? 
herbal tea . 
I'm gonna go fix it . 
oh . 
mam [: madam] , please go ahead and sit in our living+room area . 
okay , here is your herbal tea . 
mam [: madam] , you can hold it with your hands , can't you ? 
hold that . 
and here's a snack . 
you must be hungry after all that cleaning up oil . 
oh , so , so what was it like out there , cleaning up the oil ? 
oh , no . 
did you rescue that chicken ? 
it was breathing the fumes ? 
will , will , will there be a veterinarian who knows how to take care of chickens who have problems with oil spills ? 
oh , what kind of texture was that oil ? 
o:h . 
huh . 
must be hard to get clean at the end of the day for you . 
oh , did it smell bad too ? 
oh . 
hm: . 
and do you think that +//? 
it's pretty sticky , isn't it ? 
that won't hurt them ? 
oh , that's good . 
I'm sure that chicken will need to rest in the veterinary hospital for a while . 
before it's returned . 
xxx . 
okay , and what am I doing ?
