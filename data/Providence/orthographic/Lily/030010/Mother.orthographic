byebye Lulu . 
so sorry to see you go . 
okay hang on . 
which one ? 
ah let's see . 
this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one ? 
that one is oh oop ouch . 
there's so many books in there it's hard to get out . 
let me see . 
really ? 
you want the tooth fairy book ? 
look what I found over here though . 
the tooth fairy . 
I think that's the everything book . 
okay well why don't we read the tooth fairy first and then I'll hafta work on digging that other one out . 
yeah . 
right . 
you're right . 
this is the tooth fairy . 
she has lots_of teeth . 
she has lots_of dimes and quarters too . 
she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow . 
and she puts the money there instead . 
sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money . 
that this is because she works so hard . 
the tooth fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter . 
the tooth fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night . 
that's Santa with a big sack of toys . 
if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next . 
she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night . 
when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them . 
lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth . 
girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth . 
she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there . 
they do look nice there don't they ? 
pretty . 
she puts some in the bottom of the fish+bowl her fish are crazy about teeth too . 
she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone . 
she just loves jewelry . 
of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy . 
the pathway to her house is paved with teeth . 
and there are always stars outside her window at night . 
at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes+lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out . 
well it's a pretty decoration I think . 
oh really ? 
thank you . 
I do need a little trim . 
well we'll just pretend . 
snip snip snip . 
snip snip snip . 
snip snip snip . 
how does it look ? 
great . 
wow . 
oh my gosh that is so so (.) silly . 
so so silly . 
let me get that phone . 
you did ? 
yikes . 
yeah that's the only ones we ever had (be)cause you know just the little ones we got from the hospital like that size . 
yeah . 
sorry about that . 
yeah I will look but I don't think so (be)cause we didn't really I mean we wrapped her up for the first couple of weeks but that was the only time . 
we didn't finish our tooth fairy book yet . 
oh . 
sorry . 
each year the tooth fairy has a great big party and all the other fairies come to have refreshments and to play games . 
wow . 
&-um you know what I don't know if she's in this picture the tooth fairy . 
no (be)cause the tooth fairy has a big bow on her head . 
mhm . 
yeah ? 
that's a different fairy . 
no that's a different fairy (be)cause the tooth fairy has a big bow on her head . 
here's the tooth fairy . 
alright . 
great . 
well actually . 
alright there she is . 
the winner gets a prize . 
there she is . 
do you know why the tooth fairy likes to eat so much ? 
she doesn't have any of her own . 
but she hopes to grow one some day . 
just like you . 
just like you . 
yes when your baby teeth broke break you can grow a new one . 
that's right . 
right it will fall out and you'll get a new one . 
but when you're a big girl like mommy and your tooth breaks wwhada [: what do] &ou havta [: have to] do ? 
havta [: have to] go to the dentist .
